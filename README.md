# Career Prediction with Machine Learning Algorithm for Computer Science Students
Undergraduate Research Project
This application uses a ML model which was previously trained using Decisition Tree algorithm. Important factors are considered when deciding the Computer science student's career. Mostly the user's personality type and skills are considered when deciding on the career path in computer science.

#  Machine Learning model implementation
ML part of this web application is built using Python language with the help of Jupyter notebook.
Python flask framework was used in the development of this application.

#  Front-end, back-end
HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap is used in creating the frontend of the website. MySQL Database was used in the backend.

#  IDE
VS code, Jupyter notebook, MySQL

#  Testing
Testing of this application was done using Selenium IDE
